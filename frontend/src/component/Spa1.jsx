                Guests at Casa Evaliza can enjoy massages in the privacy of the villa or in any outdoor setting. Traditional Balinese massage is a remedy that has been used by Balinese villagers for many generations to relieve muscular aches and pains and boost circulation after long days of toiling in the rice fields. Using a blend of flower oil and selected herbs, hands-on healing techniques are applied with a combination of skin rolling, gentle palm pressure, long kneading strokes, acupressure and reflexology.

                Massage treatments are provided by an outside spa therapist, and a menu of options detailing the various treatments is provided in the villaâ€™s in-house documentation; the staff is on hand to assist with appointments.
