        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed font-barlow text-base sm:text-lg">
        The Master Suite encompasses the ground floor of the two-storey building. The suite is dominated by a king-size bed with a yielding padded headboard, while the wall behind displays a carved panel from a traditional house in Toraja, Sulawesi. In front of the bed is a pair of large wooden statues, depicting a Javanese wedding couple.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed font-barlow text-base sm:text-lg">
        Generously-sized, this bedroom also incorporates a sitting area furnished with a daybed and an antique desk. A 45” satellite-channel TV and DVD player rests on an antique ‘gerobok’ rice chest, juxtaposed with a window to one side that overlooks a small pebbled garden.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed font-barlow text-base sm:text-lg">
        Accessed via dramatic sliding doors, is the grand, ensuite, air-conditioned bathroom. It features an avocado-green terrazzo floor, a huge central bathtub, and two lazy chairs. A double vanity unit is fashioned in the same green terrazzo and presents two well-lit mirrors and twin washbasins. There is also a walk-in shower and a toilet hidden within an alcove. Floor-to-ceiling mirrored doors slide open to reveal a dressing room, fitted with a wall of white wardrobes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed font-barlow text-base sm:text-lg">
        Sliding glass doors from the bedroom open onto a covered veranda that runs the length of the building and looks out over the garden and is complimented with a wooden Kartini sofa and a brass gong.
