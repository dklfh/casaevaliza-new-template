        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed font-barlow text-base sm:text-lg">
        The expansive Living & Dining Pavilion is characterised by a soaring alang-alang (thatched) roof, cream terrazzo floor, and floor-to-ceiling glass doors that run the length of the building and along one side. These doors offer the options of different environments, and can be folded open to create an open-air, tropical living experience beside the garden and swimming pool. The pavilion is cooled by six powerful ceiling fans and also features the option of air-conditioning.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed font-barlow text-base sm:text-lg">
        At one side of the room is a dining table, comfortably seating ten to twelve on funky double seats fashioned from cowhide. The centre of the living pavilion is furnished with two deeply cushioned sofas and an antique coffee table, and at the far side is a hammock-style swinging daybed suspended on chains from the roof.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed font-barlow text-base sm:text-lg">
        This elegant room is completed with an ornately carved Javanese daybed, gorgeous fabrics, glass and aluminium candle lanterns, stools and a carved Buddha head in petrified wood and further complimented by a high quality audio system and a good selection of books.
